## 🤔  When do I need it?

- If you use the same spacers between certain components or elements.
- If you have a team and want it to use and apply layouts rules in a comfortable way.
- If you have multiple projects with different spacer setting and want to keep all in consistency.

## 🧞‍♂️  How it works

The plugin works in the same way as sharable styles in Figma. But the plugin stores these styles as a JSON file.
You can add so many compositions as you want and save them separately as a layouts configuration.

---

## 🤖  How to use

Before you will start to apply layouts, you need to select two or more elements. Than click “Apply” button and plugin will automatically apply auto-layout styles from the plugin's layout card.

---

## 🪢  Hook names

Hook names is a string that will be applied as an auto-layout layer name.

This is important to have distinguish and unique names for each layout, because only with this condition the plugin will be able successfully update multiple layouts automatically.

---

## 💣  Update all layouts at once by hook names

If you used the plugin before and adjusted all layouts, each type of layout will have a specific name.

Clicking on the “Update all by hooks” button the plugin will go through all compositions on the page and apply layouts styles from you configuration.

---

## 🔒  Lock composition

Each layout can be locked if you want to make your work with the plugin more safely.
