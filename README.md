## 🧞‍♂️ How it works

The plugin works in the same way as sharable styles in Figma. But the plugin stores these styles as a JSON file.
You can add so many compositions as you want and save them separately as a compositions configuration.

---

## 🤖 How to use

Before you will start to apply compositions, you need to select two or more elements. Than click “Apply” button and plugin will automatically apply auto-layout styles from the composition card.

---

## 🪢 Hook names

Hook names is a string that will be applied as an auto-layout layer name.

This is important to have distinguish and unique names for each composition, because only with this condition the plugin will be able successfully update multiple composition automatically.

---

## 💣 Update all layouts at once by hook names

If you used the plugin before and adjusted all compositions, each type of composition will have a specific name.

Clicking on the “Update all by hooks” button the plugin will go through all compositions on all file pages and apply compositions styles from you configuration.

---

## 🔒 Lock composition

Each composition can be locked if you want to make your work with the plugin more safely.
